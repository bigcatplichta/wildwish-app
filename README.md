# WILDWISH APP  

# Description

This web app is a simple site where visitors are able to see a list of 'wishes' to be fulfilled on the landing page. Each 'wish' has a specific animal and a toy attributed to it. Each donation funds the wish. When the wish is fully funded, the toy will be sent to the animal and a new wish will be selected to then be displayed on the landing page.

Donors will be emailed when the animal receives the toy. The receiving zookeeper will be prompted to upload a picture of the animal with the new toy. This picture will be displayed in the thank you email to every donor who helped fund that wish.

# Dependencies

This app uses the Devise gem for authentication and CanCanCan for authorization. Run 'bundle install' to install all dependencies.

# Running

Run 'Rails server' in the terminal to start the server, and navigate to the port listed to view and interact with the app.
